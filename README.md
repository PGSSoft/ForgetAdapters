# ForgetAdapters
An Android library, which (extremely) simplifies seeding lists with data

No more adapters. You're gonna love this.

# Introduction

Implementing lists in Android requires much boilerplate code. Each time you create new list, you need to create a new adapter, which seeds that list with data. Fortunately, since Google introduced Data Binding Library, this process may be simplified. A lot.

We dare say, that we bring that boilerplate code to absolute minimum (minus code you'd have to write anyway). Catch? We assume, that the application is being written according to MVVM pattern.

# How to use

TODO - add jitpack/maven link

## Create a list in activity
